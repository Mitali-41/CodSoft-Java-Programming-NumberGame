Task 1:- Number Game
This Java program is a simple **Number Guessing Game** where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game allows multiple rounds, with players having the option to continue or quit after each round. A scoring system rewards players based on the number of attempts it takes to guess the correct number, encouraging quicker guesses. The program includes robust error handling to ensure valid input, such as checking for numbers within the range and managing invalid entries gracefully. Players receive dynamic feedback during the game, such as hints if their guess is too high or too low. The game maintains a cumulative score across rounds and concludes by displaying the playerâ€™s final score, making it both interactive and engaging. This project serves as an excellent introduction to using loops, conditional statements, and error handling in Java.
